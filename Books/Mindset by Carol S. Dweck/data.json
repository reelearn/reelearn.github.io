      "text": "In the first part of Mindset, Carol S. Dweck introduces the concept of mindset and its impact on our lives. She explains that people generally have one of two mindsets: a fixed mindset or a growth mindset. Those with a fixed mindset believe that their abilities and intelligence are fixed traits, while those with a growth mindset believe that they can develop and improve their abilities through effort and learning. Dweck argues that having a growth mindset is crucial for personal and professional growth, as it allows individuals to embrace challenges, learn from failures, and ultimately reach their full potential.",

Dweck emphasizes that a fixed mindset limits personal and professional growth, as individuals are less likely to take risks or seek opportunities for improvement. She provides examples from various domains, such as sports and relationships, to illustrate the detrimental effects of a fixed mindset.",
