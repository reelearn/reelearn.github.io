      "text": "In the first part of The Power of Habit, Charles Duhigg introduces the concept of the habit loop. He explains that habits are formed through a three-step process: cue, routine, and reward. The cue triggers a specific behavior or routine, which then leads to a reward. Duhigg emphasizes that understanding this loop is crucial for changing and forming new habits. He provides examples of how habits can be powerful forces in our lives, both positive and negative, and how they can shape our behavior and decision-making.",
