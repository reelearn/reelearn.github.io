        <p>In 'A Scandal in Bohemia,' Holmes is hired by the King of Bohemia to retrieve a compromising photograph of him and an American opera singer named Irene Adler. Adler is a clever and resourceful woman who outwits Holmes on several occasions. Despite his initial failure to retrieve the photograph, Holmes develops a deep respect for Adler's intelligence and integrity. In the end, Adler outsmarts Holmes once again and manages to escape with the photograph. This story challenges Holmes' usual arrogance and highlights the power of a strong and intelligent female character. It also showcases Holmes' ability to appreciate and admire worthy opponents, even when they are on the wrong side of the law.</p>
