        <p>In 'The Red-Headed League,' Holmes and Watson are approached by a man named Jabez Wilson, who tells them about a strange organization that he has become a member of. The organization, known as the Red-Headed League, pays Wilson to copy out the Encyclopedia Britannica. However, Wilson becomes suspicious when the League suddenly disbands. Holmes investigates the matter and uncovers a clever scheme orchestrated by a criminal mastermind named John Clay. Clay used the League as a distraction to dig a tunnel from Wilson's shop to a nearby bank, where he planned to carry out a robbery. With Holmes' intervention, Clay is apprehended, and the stolen goods are recovered. This story showcases Holmes' ability to see through elaborate ruses and his determination to protect innocent people from harm.</p>
