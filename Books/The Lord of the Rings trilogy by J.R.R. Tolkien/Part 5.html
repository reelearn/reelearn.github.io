    <div class="summary">
        <p>Throughout the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the power of friendship is a central theme. Frodo and Sam's unwavering loyalty to each other is a driving force in their quest to destroy the One Ring. Their friendship is tested time and again as they face danger, exhaustion, and the corrupting influence of the ring. Other friendships also play important roles, such as the bond between Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, who support and rely on each other in battle. The power of friendship is portrayed as a source of strength and hope in the face of overwhelming darkness. It is through the unity and support of their companions that the characters are able to overcome their individual weaknesses and achieve their goals.</p>
