        <p>Separated from the rest of the fellowship, Frodo and Sam continue their perilous journey towards Mount Doom. Meanwhile, the other members of the fellowship face their own trials. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli join forces with the kingdom of Rohan to defend against the forces of Sauron. They engage in epic battles and form alliances with the Ents, ancient tree-like beings. Gandalf returns as Gandalf the White, more powerful than before, and aids in the fight against evil. The two towers, Orthanc and Barad-d√ªr, play significant roles in the story as strongholds of power. As the war escalates, the fate of Middle-earth hangs in the balance.</p>
