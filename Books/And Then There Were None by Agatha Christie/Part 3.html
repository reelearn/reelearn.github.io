        <p>The first death occurs when one of the guests, Anthony Marston, suddenly chokes and dies after drinking a poisoned cocktail. The remaining guests are shaken by this unexpected tragedy and start to suspect each other. They search for clues and try to piece together the puzzle, but mistrust and paranoia begin to consume them. As they delve deeper into the past, they uncover connections between their crimes and the nursery rhyme 'Ten Little Soldiers' displayed in each of their rooms. The rhyme serves as a chilling reminder of their impending doom.</p>
