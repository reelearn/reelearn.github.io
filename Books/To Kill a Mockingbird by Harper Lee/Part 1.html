        <p>To Kill a Mockingbird, written by Harper Lee, is set in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama. The story is narrated by Scout Finch, a young girl growing up in the 1930s. Scout introduces us to her family, including her older brother Jem and their father Atticus, a respected lawyer. Maycomb is a small, close-knit community where everyone knows each other's business. Scout and Jem befriend a boy named Dill and the three of them become fascinated by their reclusive neighbor, Boo Radley. The first part of the book sets the stage for the racial tensions and social injustices that will be explored later on.</p>
