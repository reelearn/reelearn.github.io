    <div class="summary">
        <p>In the second part of the book, Atticus is appointed to defend Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman, Mayella Ewell. The trial becomes a significant event in Maycomb, exposing the deep-rooted racism and prejudice of the town. Atticus presents a strong case, proving Tom's innocence, but despite the evidence, the all-white jury convicts Tom. This injustice deeply affects Scout and Jem, as they witness the flaws of the justice system and the harsh reality of racial discrimination.</p>
