        <h2>Part 4: Lessons in Empathy and Compassion</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="summary">
        <p>Scout and Jem learn valuable lessons about empathy and compassion through their interactions with Boo Radley and the trial of Tom Robinson. Atticus teaches them to see the world from other people's perspectives and to stand up for what is right, even in the face of adversity. These lessons shape their understanding of justice and equality, and they begin to question the deeply ingrained prejudices of Maycomb society.</p>
