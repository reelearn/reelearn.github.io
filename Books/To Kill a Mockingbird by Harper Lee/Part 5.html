        <p>In the aftermath of the trial, Maycomb's community members show their true colors. Some are supportive of Atticus and his fight for justice, while others resent him for challenging the status quo. Scout and Jem experience both the kindness and the cruelty of their neighbors. However, they also witness acts of solidarity and compassion, reminding them that not everyone in Maycomb is blinded by prejudice.</p>
