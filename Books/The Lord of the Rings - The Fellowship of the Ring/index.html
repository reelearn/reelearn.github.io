            <h2>Part 1: The Shire and the Ring</h2>
            <p>In the first part of The Fellowship of the Ring, we are introduced to the peaceful land of the Shire, where hobbits live. The story begins with Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit who possesses a mysterious ring. Bilbo passes the ring onto his nephew, Frodo, and warns him of its power. Gandalf, a wise wizard, confirms that the ring is the One Ring, created by the Dark Lord Sauron. Frodo realizes that he must leave the Shire to keep the ring safe from Sauron's grasp.</p>

Along the way, they encounter the mysterious Strider, who is later revealed to be Aragorn, the rightful heir to the throne of Gondor. Together, they form the Fellowship of the Ring, a group tasked with protecting Frodo and aiding him in his quest.</p>
